## 📃 Description

Marked is a modern note-taking app which allows users to write Markdown-formatted notes for quick yet easy formatting, improving the legibility of their notes. The app currently allows users to create an account, create new notes and update them, see a list of their previously created notes, and delete unneeded notes. Furthermore, users are also able to create collections to better organize their notes. These collections can also be updated and deleted, and are listed alongside the notes.

## 🔍 Background Information

I am creating this project as part of my studies at General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp.

The reason I chose to create a Markdown note-taking app as my project despite its being a basic idea is because I've always been interested in Markdown as a means of formatting notes and content as opposed to using traditional rich text formatting. I've also wanted to start my own tech blog and publish articles using Markdown for the longest time, so I am also hoping that this project will serve as a stepping stone helping to facilitate that goal in the future.
